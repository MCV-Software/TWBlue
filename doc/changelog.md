TWBlue Changelog

## changes in this version

* Added filtering capabilities to TWBlue. ([#102](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/102))
    * You can create a filter for the current buffer from the buffer menu in the menu bar. At this moment, invisible interface does not have any shorcut for this.
    * You can create filters by word or languages.
    * For deleting already created filters, you can go to the filter manager in the buffer menu and delete the filters you won't need.
* Links should be opened properly in quoted tweets ([#167,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/167) [#184](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/184))

* In the translator module, the list of available languages is fetched automatically from the provider. That means all of these languages will work and there will not be inconsistencies.
