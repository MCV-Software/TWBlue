## Changes in version 0.94

* Added an option in the global settings dialog to disable the Streaming features of TWBlue. TWBlue will remove all Streaming features after August 16, so this option will give people an idea about how it will be. ([#219](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/219))
* Due to Twitter API changes, Switched authorisation method to Pin-code based authorisation. When you add new accounts to TWBlue, you will be required to paste a code displayed in the Twitter website in order to grant access to TWBlue. ([#216](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/216))
* In order to comply with latest Twitter changes, TWBlue has switched to the new method used to send and receive direct messages, according to issue [#215.](https://github.com/manuelcortez/twblue/issues/215)

* Added a new tab called feedback, in the account settings dialog. This tab allows you to control whether automatic speech or Braille feedbak in certain events (mentions and direct messages received) is enabled. Take into account that this option will take preference over automatic reading of buffers and any kind of automatic output. ([#203](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/203))
* The spell checking dialog now has access keys defined for the most important actions. ([#211](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/211))

    * For liking a tweet, press Control+Windows+alt+f
    * for opening a trends buffer, press control+Windows+T
* TWBlue has received improvements in some functions for handling extended tweets, long tweets and quoted retweets. It should render some tweets in a better way.

* In the translator module, the list of available languages is fetched automatically from the provider. That means all of these languages will work and there will not be inconsistencies.
