"Twitter is a social networking or micro-blogging tool which allows you to "

"to authorise the application, you just need to run the main executable file, "
"called TWBlue.exe (on some computers it may appear simply as TWBlue if "
"Windows Explorer is not set to display file extensions). We suggest you may "
"like to place a Windows shortcut on your Desktop pointing to this executable "

"many accounts as you wish. If you press the Tab key to reach the \"new "
"account\" button and activate it by pressing the Space Bar, a dialogue box "
"will advise you that your default internet browser will be opened in order "
"to authorise the application and you will be asked if you would like to "
